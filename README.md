# Vega internhip project
One of the projects I did during a three-week internship at VEGA IT. The task was to make a responsive and pixel perfect page based on the design given in FIGMA.

## Project Details
Styling was done in SASS and class names adhere to BEM naming principles.
Node.js and Gulp were used to: 
* preprocess SASS into CSS
* Sync chnages to live browser with BrowserSync
* turn SVG files to icon-font
* copy all files and assets to dist folder

### To make development changes 
Download the project and run npm install to install dependencies.
